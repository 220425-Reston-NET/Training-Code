# Group Activity
* You will present the menu app to everyone on next week Friday (Since we don't have that much time this week to do it).
* We will continue building this menu app as we learn more and more topics this week.
* If you need help, your group mates are your best resource so ask them before you ask me anything.
* You will be in groups but you have the capabilities to go to different breakout rooms so if your group doesn't know how to do something maybe start exploring and collaborating with other groups.
## Re-create your old shell menu using C# language
1. Create a different C# file named Menu.cs in HelloWorld
2. Create a Menu class and put in all the class members (such as field, property, methods, etc.) you think you'll need to re-create your shell menu
	* Note: Program.cs is the starting point of your program
3. Push all the changes to your remote github repo.
Note: Look into Console.ReadLine() as it is similar to read command in shell

## Add more function to your Menu console app
1. Create a new C# file inside your menu project called Data
2. Create a Data class that will hold a collection of something for your menu
3. Add any class members (methods, constructors, properties, fields, etc.) to Data class that you think will be useful to accomplish the following functions 
3. Add function to Menu to add elements to a collection
    * This function might look different depending on what theme you created for your menu app
    * Ex: If it is a shopping app then maybe a cart system would make the most sense
4. Add function to Menu to display all the current elements to a collection
5. Add function to Menu to remove certain elements to a collection
6. Add function to Menu to search for a certain element in a collection
    * Look into C# documentation of what methods are available for you in the collection that you are using that might help you find certain elements
    * You can also just create your own coding logic to find certain elements in a collection
    * If no element exist, be sure to tell the user that the element was not found.
